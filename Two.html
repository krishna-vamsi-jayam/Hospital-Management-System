<h1><font color="CornflowerBlue">VISION & MISSION</font></h1>
<b>HEALTH CARE </b>Hospitals is a multi-speciality hospital offering advanced medical treatments, diagnostics & day care specialty facilities. We treat patients with unconditional love and affection which tends to their speed recovery process. HEALTH CARE hospitals has always championed social initiatives that transcend social and income barriers. Notable ventures introduced by the organization are Save a Child's Heart Initiative (SACHi) which provides quality paediatric cardiac care to children from underprivileged sections of society. SAHI (Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired) and the CURE Foundation focused on cancer care assist children from financially challenged homes. Envisioned by Dr. Reddy, to introduce population health into the Indian narrative, the Total Health Foundation is piloting a unique model of healthcare in the Thavanampalle Mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to provide "healthcare" for the entire community starting from birth, through one's journey into childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.
